# Atmospheric chemistry 

## Atmospheric chemistry codes

All work by minimising the Gibbs free energy of the system for a given pressure and temperature. 

- ACE (Agundez et al., 2012, 2020)
- FastChem10 (Stock et al., 2018)
- GGchem11 (Woitke et al., 2018)

They are included in various atmospheric modelling and retrieval codes such as

- TauREx3 (Al-Refaie et al., 2021), ACE is included as standard, with the option to include the others using
TauRExâ€™s plugin feature;
- ARCiS (Ormel and Min, 2019, Min et al., 2020), GGchem is fully integrated; 
- HELIOS (Malik et al., 2017, Kitzmann et al., 2020) with FastChem as the main chemical model
- petitRADTRANS (Molliere et al., 2019) includes self-written chemical routine easyCHEM
- Exo-REM (Baudino et al., 2015) includes self-written chemical routines.
